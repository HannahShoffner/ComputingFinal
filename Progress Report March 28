The goal of the video editing part of this project is to use the MoviePy software 
to edit the length and size of videos of worms for our capstone project, and 
possibly to accentuate worm movement with highlighting images like a red circle. 
So far, the MoviePy software was downloaded from the following website:
https://pypi.org/project/moviepy/ 
Ideas for Python video editing tools were based of this site:
https://cloudinary.com/guides/front-end-development/python-video-processing-6-useful-libraries-and-a-quick-tutorial#moviepy 
The library was used to shorten a video of worms to only include the part where
the camera was steady. In future projects, it will be used to crop this and other 
videos to only include where worms of interest are swimming.
